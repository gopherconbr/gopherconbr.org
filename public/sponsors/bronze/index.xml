      <description>NATS is a high performance, open source messaging system designed for microservices, cloud native and IoT applications. The NATS Server is written in Golang, and there are also dozens of client libraries available.
Just like Go, NATS is all about simplicity and performance, making it an ideal choice for building high availability distributed systems. The protocol is plain-text, lightweight (the Docker image is a mere 7MB) and capable of sending over 10 Million messages per second while maintaining near zero latency.</description>
