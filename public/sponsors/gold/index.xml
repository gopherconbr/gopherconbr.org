      <description>We build Cloud Foundry using Go. We test drive, pair program and iterate. We tackle challenging and complex distributed systems problems, at scale, and build robust solutions that operate - unattended - across the majority of public clouds and behind our Fortune 500 customers&#39; firewalls. We are transforming how the world builds software by bringing the elegant simplicity of Cloud Foundry to our Enterprise customers. By running their applications on Cloud Foundry, developers can cut iteration cycle times from months to minutes and focus on the important stuff: building great digital applications that deliver value.</description>

      <guid>http://gopherconbr.org/en/sponsors/gold/minio/</guid>
      <description>Minio is an object storage server, designed to be minimal and scalable. It stores objects such as photos, videos, container/VM images, log files and archives. Minio liberates applications written in the cloud to freely move to any private or public cloud environment, by enabling them to easily build their own scalable cloud storage infrastructure. Minio is hardware agnostic and works on a variety of physical and virtual/container environments. Minio is light enough to be bundled along with the application stack, similar to NodeJS and Redis.</description>
