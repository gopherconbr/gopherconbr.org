<h2>GopherCon Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>All delegates, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any Gopher Academy event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>

<h4>The Quick Version</h4>

<p>
Gopher Academy is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>

<h4>The Less Quick Version</h4>
<p>
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
 

<blockquote>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</blockquote>

<p>
Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

<p>
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

<p>
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by a clearly marked "STAFF" shirt.</p>

<p>
Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
</p>

<p>
We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.  We think people should follow these rules outside conference activities too!</p>

<p>
[This code of conduct was borrowed from the folks at JSConf, with permission.  We think they did a very nice job of laying out the expectations of conference participants and appreciate the fact that they let us use it, nearly verbatim.]</p>
