# We Value Everyone in Our Community
GopherCon Brasil is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion preferences. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: offensive verbal comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and any unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified on the days of the conference by their Staff t-shirts. You may also email us at info@gopherconbr.org or contact us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/gopherconbr) (DM us). If the person who is harassing you is a member of the conference staff, they will recuse themselves from being involved in handling the incident. In order to protect our team from abuse, we reserve the right to reject any complaint we feel was made in bad faith or made in an attempt to silence other attendees or intimidate presenters.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.

Our staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide safety escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.

If you have any questions or concerns about this code please contact the GopherCon Brasil conference organizers by sending an email to info@gopherconbr.org.
